String Abstract Data Type (ADT) Implementation

 Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the **String Abstract Data Type (ADT)**. The String ADT provides a set of operations that can be performed on strings, such as creation, manipulation, comparison, and more. The implementation is designed to handle strings efficiently and provide an interface for common string operations used in various applications.

## Features

- **String Creation**: Initialize strings with different constructors (empty, from char array, etc.).
- **Concatenation**: Combine two strings into one.
- **Length Calculation**: Get the length of the string.
- **Substring Extraction**: Extract substrings from a given string.
- **Comparison**: Compare two strings.
- **Character Access**: Access individual characters in the string.
- **Modification**: Replace, insert, or delete characters within the string.
- **Searching**: Find substrings or characters within the string.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of dynamic memory allocation.
